## What is Sprinkler Run?
Sprinkler Run is an infinite runner game made to run in a web browser. You might be asking your self what is an infinite runner? dont you worry its all explained in the text below.

### What is an Infinte Runner?
If you know what an infinite runner is please skip to the idea. If you don't let me enlighten you. 
An infinte runner is a style of a platform game in which the character runs non-stop through a hazardous course, and must be guided to jum, duck, etc. to avoid the hazards.

### The idea
The game will be based upon a character running through a field with a series of randomly generated sprinklers that the player must avoid in order to progress. If by any means the player runs into or is hit by a sprinkler a life will be deducted, once the player looses three lives the game over screen will be diplayed showing the total distance travelled, time survived, sprinklers dodges and the players highscore. If the player happens to be talented and lives past the first thirty seconds the speed of the game will increase, this will continue to happen every thirty seconds until the player reaches zero lives. Now you might be telling your self that is to simple so I have added a little bit of spice here goes nothing. The game will not only be made up of one character or one sprinkler or one background, you will be able to purchase cosmetic upgrades in the store which will then change how the game looks. Now how can one get the cashoola to purchase these items? duh by collecting randomly generated cashoola whilst playing the game. Not every cashoola will be of the same value becasue that would be boring so to reward staying alive for a longer period of time higher value cashoola will be awared to the player. If the player is extremely talented and happends to live past 60 seconds the sprinklers will start to rotate just like they would in real life, as well as the speed increase as the player progresses.
